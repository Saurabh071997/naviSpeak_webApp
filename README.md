# <span style="font-size: 3rem">**NAVI SPEAK ðŸ˜ƒ**</span>

A web app build with **HTML** , **CSS** ,  and **Vanilla JS** .

The motive of this app was to build a beginner's level  web app to undertstand the various functionalities of **Javascript**. 
<br>

**NAVI Speak is a translator application.**<br>
Users can provide any english sentence/word as an input to the web application and the translator converts that input sentence to **navi language**.
<br>

<span style="font-size:1.5rem">**NAVI Language**</span> is a finctional language created for the natives of **PANDORA** in the movie **AVATAR**.
Even after a decade the movie is still quite popular among the fans.<br>
This application lets those hardcore fans enjoy the **navi language**.
<br>
<br>
Apart from that users can also listenðŸ”Š to the translation via the **listen translation ðŸ”Š** button provided in the application.  
<br><br>


<span style="font-size:2rem">**Project Details**</span><br>
The javascript part of the web application uses the concepts of 
**DOM** (Document Object Model) such as **document** interface , 
**querySelector()** method of document and **addEventListener** method.<br><br>

To implemenet the translator I used <span style="font-size:1.25rem">**[funtranslations](https://funtranslations.com/)**</span> api. For this application the <span style="font-size:1.25rem">**[navi api](https://funtranslations.com/api/navi)**</span> provided by funtranslations have been used. To use these external APIs in the application we used **fetch()** api which provides an interface for fetching resources via urls.
<br><br>
For the listening part of the application I used <span style="font-size:1.25rem">**[SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)**</span> interface of the **Web Speech API**.
